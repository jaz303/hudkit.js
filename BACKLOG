Stuff that I'm deliberately leaving until later:

[ ] Buttons - refactor to wrapper <a> and absolutely position <span> for label
    (means button label will always be vertically centered)
[ ] Buttons - support icons

[ ] Dialog - truncate title bar when dialog is small
[ ] Dialog - transition for rolling/unrolling
[ ] Split pane - min/max size policy
[ ] Split pane - preserve proportions after outer resize
[ ] Split pane - set split in absolute pixel size rather than proportion

IDEAS
=====
[ ] Position mode; should it be possible to make a single dimension (e.g. width/height)
    explicit, while leaving the other auto?

BUGS
====
[ ] Resizing split pane cursor is incorrect when code editor widget is on-screen
    In fact, drag cursor behaviour is wrong everywhere - wtf...
[ ] Split-pane resizing is broken on Safari
